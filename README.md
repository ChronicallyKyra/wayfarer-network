# wayfarer-network

<p>~Welcome, Traveller</p>


Some kind of network of AU/storytelling sites or in-verse internets.

Consists of a central site that describes the project and has a map of all Dreams -- The Epoch.  Sites are all based on an OSS model or server or something that connects them to the network.  This could be done by a webcrawler looking for something specific, or by websites making themselves known to the master server.  Could even be by a more decentralized model where servers communicate with each other for discovery, like i2p or TOR (This would be difficult).  In this case, there would have to be a portal that would be a part of this network and allow users to browse the members of the network.  

Nodes could be thought of like star systems or galaxies -- Isolated worlds/universes that can have their own subcategories and things.  Called Dreams?  

Because each Dream is self-hosted, worrying about users and authentication and things is unnecessary.  Dreams are identified by themselves.

Dreams should also be able to form links with other Dreams that connect them.  These links should be created by sharing public keys between two Dreams.
